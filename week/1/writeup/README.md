### Part 2 (75 pts)

The first person that I would inform would be my direct supervisor. As a junior developer, it would not be my place nor responsibility to do anything more. If my direct supervisor wants me to inform someone higher up in the company with my findings, then I would do so. If this bug or flaw is very bad, I might make a case/presentation on my findings to try and persuade my superiors that this could loose them money and reputation. However I would only do so within reasonable bounds and not overextend myself. I would make perfectly clear the risks and potential losses/benefits but I would respect the final decision since it is not mine to make. There would be no reason for me to involve anyone else. That decision should be for the project lead or company head. If my company is unwilling to respond or do anything to fix this bug, that is of no concern of mine. It is unfortunate that they are not willing to do anything, but this is not my decision to make. Regardless of the repercussions, as a junior developer I have done all that is required of me. I would not feel responsible for anything that results of this issue. If my superiors are incapable of making proper decisions regarding their own company and software, then they would be responsible for any outcomes of their choices.
